Esther Kudoro developed a machine learning model for fault prediction in electrical transmission lines.
The model was designed to classify different types of electrical faults, including line-to-ground and line-to-line-ground faults.
She performed feature engineering using voltage and current signals to improve model performance.
The machine learning model achieved very high classification accuracy.
The model was deployed using FastAPI to enable real-time fault prediction.
Esther has also been involved in teaching and mentoring in robotics and embedded systems workshops.
