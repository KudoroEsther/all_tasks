The weekly task folders in the all_tasks repository represent Esther’s incremental learning journey in coding.
Each folder corresponds to a different week, implying consistent practice and structured learning.
This progression aids in building a strong foundation in Python syntax, control structures, data types, and libraries like Pandas.
This practice also supports machine learning learning paths, given associated datasets in the Dataset repository.
This demonstrates Esther’s commitment to continuous skill development through practical coding work.
